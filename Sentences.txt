About your project's scope
It's managed by a third party
It's a legacy system
It's "too critical to patch"
About your outage windows
About your budget
You've always done it that way
About your Go-Live Date
It's only a pilot/proof of concept
About Non-Disclosure Agreements
It wasn't a requirement in the contract
It's an internal system
It's really hard to change
It's due for replacement
You're not sure how to fix it
It's handled in the Cloud
About your Risk Register entry
The vendor doesn't support that configuration
It's an interim solution
It's [insert standard here] compliant
It's encrypted on disk
The cost benefit doesn't stack up
"Nobody else could figure that out"
You can't explain the risk to "The Business"
You've got other priorities
About your faith in the competence of your internal users
You don't have a business justification
You can't show Return on Investment
You contracted out that risk
